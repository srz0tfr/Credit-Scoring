# Credit Score Classification using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

## Overview
This project implements a credit score classification model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The goal is to predict the credit score category based on various financial attributes.

## Project Files
- **`credit-score-classification-with-ann.ipynb`** - Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **`Final Project Presentation.pdf`** - A summary presentation of the project findings.
- **`Final Project Report.pdf`** - A detailed report outlining methodology, dataset, and results.
- **`predicted_results.csv`** - A CSV file with predicted credit scores.

## Installation & Dependencies
To run this project, you need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow keras matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## Running the Project
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Load the `credit-score-classification-with-ann.ipynb` file.
3. Run the notebook cells step by step to train the model and generate predictions.
4. The final predicted results are saved in `predicted_results.csv`.

## Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is cleaned and normalized for better ANN performance.
- **Model Training**: A neural network is implemented using TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Evaluation**: Model accuracy and loss are visualized to assess performance.

## Results
The trained ANN model predicts credit scores with high accuracy, providing valuable insights for financial decision-making.
